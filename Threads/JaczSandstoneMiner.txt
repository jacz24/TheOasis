This is my first script release using Wasplib and I've been testing it for a couple weeks and feel it is time for a alpha release.

Requirements and setup:

- Circlet of Water is required for this script as it will not stop even while taking damage in its current state
so make sure you have a ton of charges. Varrock armor and desert clothes are a plus! Graceful if you have it can be good :D

- Make sure you are inside the sandstone mine and close to the ores by the grinder when you start the script

- Just run the default option for now as the other options aren't in production yet.

Future Features:

- Dragon Pickaxe spec

 - Full humidify for waterskins

- Running to buy more waterskins from shanty pass

- Better ore pathing

- World hopping if player


This is revision 1 so it is very bare bones but it works quite well all things considered. I'm unsure how much I will add to the future feautures as I have no need for them. If people would like they can reach me in the discord with additions. I will also upload this to the Oasis (will provide a link at a later date)

For now it works well for me and i'm happy with its state. I recommend you keep an eye on it while it mines.

Changes:
 - New Revisions support updated Forms!
